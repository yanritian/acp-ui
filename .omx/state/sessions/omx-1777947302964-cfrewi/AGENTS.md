**Session:** omx-1777947302964-cfrewi | 2026-05-05T02:15:06.176Z

**Codebase Map:**
  src/: main, vite-env.d
  src/lib/: acp-bridge, output-buffer.test, acp-session-runner, output-buffer, runtime-errors, types, feature-registry, storage, platform
  src/stores/: multi-session.test, config, memory, multi-session, session, team-runtime, traffic, workflows
  src/test/: setup
  tests/: agent-teams.spec
  (root): vite.config

**Explore Command Preference:** enabled via `USE_OMX_EXPLORE_CMD` (default-on; opt out with `0`, `false`, `no`, or `off`)
- Advisory steering only: agents SHOULD treat `omx explore` as the default first stop for direct inspection and SHOULD reserve `omx sparkshell` for qualifying read-only shell-native tasks.
- For simple file/symbol lookups, use `omx explore` FIRST before attempting full code analysis.
- When the user asks for a simple read-only exploration task (file/symbol/pattern/relationship lookup), strongly prefer `omx explore` as the default surface.
- Explore examples: `omx explore...

**Compaction Protocol:**
Before context compaction, preserve critical state:
1. Write progress checkpoint via state_write MCP tool
2. Save key decisions to notepad via notepad_write_working
3. If context is >80% full, proactively checkpoint state

<ralph_native_subagents>
You are in OMX Ralph persistence mode.
Primary task: ralph-cli-launch
Parallelism guidance:
- Prefer Codex native subagents for independent parallel subtasks.
- Treat `.omx/state/subagent-tracking.json` as the native subagent activity ledger for this session.
- Do not declare the task complete, and do not transition into final verification/completion, while active native subagent threads are still running.
- Before closing a verification wave, confirm that active native subagent threads have drained.
Final deslop guidance:
- Step 7.5 must run oh-my-codex:ai-slop-cleaner in standard mode on changed files only, using the repo-relative paths listed in `.omx/ralph/changed-files.txt`.
- Keep the cleaner scope bounded to that file list; do not widen the pass to the full codebase or unrelated files.
- Step 7.6 must rerun the current tests/build/lint verification after ai-slop-cleaner; if regression fails, roll back cleaner changes or fix and retry before completion.
